# Rate My Professor Extension

A Chrome extension that enhances University of Waterloo's course selection pages by displaying real-time professor ratings from RateMyProfessor. Built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, this extension integrates the RateMyProfessor GraphQL API to provide insights directly on the page.


# Limitations

- The professorExtractor.js module currently uses a simulated professor name for demo purposes. Customize it to parse your universityâ€™s page DOM.

- Deprecated API
